## Installation

This code was developed using [Python 3.12.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3128/), and compatible with Python versions 3.11 and 3.10. We utilise [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) to manage Python packages and dependencies for ease-of-use and consistent deployment.

To install the required packages, clone the repo and install the required dependencies as follows:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adammuhtar/ship-detection.git
cd ship-classifier-cnn
python -m pip install poetry
poetry install
```

We use the [MASATI-v2](https://www.iuii.ua.es/datasets/masati/) (MAritime SATellite Imagery) dataset from [Gallego et al. (2018)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/4/511) to train our models, which can be obtained for free for non-profit research or educational purposes at [https://www.iuii.ua.es/datasets/masati/](https://www.iuii.ua.es/datasets/masati/). We recommend that the unzipped [MASATI-v2](https://www.iuii.ua.es/datasets/masati/) dataset be stored inside a new `data` directory (not included here) for consistency of code.
